					<h4>I want to make a tiny house that is accessible and afforable as possible. And a variety of possibility requires a variety of help and skills.</h4>
					<h4>Can you help me?</h4>
					<p>To love and be loved as I have been is a gift.</p>
					<p>I think it's kind of weird to name a house but it seemed like this project should have some reference than just "My Tiny House Project". So, out of my love for alliteration,<i> Sweet Spirit</i> came up.</p>
					<p><i>Sweet</i> from <i>sweetgrass</i> inspired from my long journey of completing <i>Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants</i> by Robin Wall Kimmerer. And <i>Spirit</i> from <i>Two-Spirit.</i> More info here (eventually).<i></p>
					<p>Braiding Sweetgrass</i> has has been a book that so succinctly reflects my understanding and belief of gratitude and I really appreciate that. Being Two-Spirit reflects me.</p>
					<p>	This project is to give. Give back? I want to love people just how they are, how the see fit, in their own worlds.</p>

					<p>I've also wrestled with Black De Novo. Because I'm Black and that holds significance. And I learned 'de novo' from Jessica Jones Season 2. It means to begin a new. Or from what I understood from the show: to begin again; belonging nowhere. Which is how I often feel and seems to fit with the experience of traveling. </p>
					<h4>What do you think?</h4>

					<p>My motivation to take this journey rests in multiple directions. I want to acquire skills that I have not had access to or necessarily been exposed to but have an interest and desire in. Such skills at prest day may be described as skills of "self sufficiency". I place this term in quotes because I hold a distaste for it. The practice of self-sufficiency skills in popular media is often perpetuated by white bodies, removed from the origin of the practice and thus the rest of the process and peoples it comes from. That is to say "self-sufficient" skills are and have been those derived from necessity and custom but this experience is now commodified. And a bad taste remains in my mouth.</p>
					<p>Another direction of this journey is to socialize? To commune? To listen. I love stories. I want to listen to stories people tell about themselves and their people. How people love through their language and food and touch. People are beautiful and terrifying and I want to see them as they see themselves. I wnat to see people smile. I want to be able to love people in their own worlds. Even if its only a moment.</p>
					<p>I want to get to know the Earth. That can't be done if I stay in the same place. Or even if so, that isn't how I want to do it. I have an urge to move/travel (even though I'm a big homebody).</p>
					<p>Instead of taveling the states merely for the views, I want to use my ability to travel with this house to learn more about Black & Indigenous foodways including preparation, preservation, hunting, fishing, storage, and the like when possible or the opportunity is offered.</p>
					<p>I want to be a healer, particularly with food and plants. So I want to learn more about this knowledge and experiences from the people I come from and have relations to. I'd be happy to learn from others as well. Black and Native people are those that I'm generally most comfortable being around so it seems like a good place for this journey to start.</p>
					<p>I would like to meet people who:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>need me to do labor for them (a list of options)</li>
						<li>can teach me foodways skills (hunting, fishing, skinning, preservaing, tracking, cooking, etc)</li>
						<li>want to share a story</li>
						<li>can provide a place to park my house & truck</li>
						<li>want to meet</li>
						<li>want to travel with me</li>
					</ol>
