					<h1>About the Project</h1>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>My purpose is to travel what is commonly referred to as the United States in a community constructed mobile home to learn more about Black and Native foodways.  The mobile house as well as the vehicle used to tow it will be tools in service to the communities I am a guest in. </p>
					<p>The bodies of Black and Native people have been controlled by forces outside of our communities for a very long time. Though there are many, I’m interested in the ways that food (the well-being of the body), movement (access to place and space), and knowledge (how we know and get to know ourselves and the world) are made inaccessible. With these learnings, in collaboration and in support to the community, I hope to be facilitate a little more balance due to this lack of access. In embarking on this task of learning, giving, and being of service, I hope to better fulfill my role in the community as a Black Two-Spirit person in the world.

					<h1>About me</a></h1>
					<p>I don’t believe that it is necessary for me to talk about myself when this work should be valued and worthwhile and getting done whether or not it is me doing it. I’m also not inclined to talk about myself and when I do it usually isn’t well. However, it is my understanding that in order for people to be persuaded to participate in something they must find interest in it, and in many cases they must find themselves in it through someone or something they can relate to. Given that I need help and all kinds of support, it seems appropriate and necessary that I do what it takes to get folks interested including allowing people to get to know me. As a compromise, I have provided a list of stories or testimonials from people who know and have known me, so that you (someone who I hope may support this work in some capacity) may become familiar with me and why I can do this project. Check them out <b><a href="testimonials.html">here.</a></b></p><br>
