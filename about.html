					<h4>I want to make a tiny house that is accessible and afforable as possible. And a variety of possibility requires a variety of help and skills.</h4>
					<h4>Can you help me?</h4>
					<p>To love and be loved as I have been is a gift.</p>
					<p>I think it's kind of weird to name a house but it seemed like this project should have some reference than just "My Tiny House Project". So, out of my love for alliteration,<i> Sweet Spirit</i> came up.</p>
					<p><i>Sweet</i> from <i>sweetgrass</i> inspired from my long journey of completing <i>Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants</i> by Robin Wall Kimmerer. And <i>Spirit</i> from <i>Two-Spirit.</i> More info here (eventually).<i></p>
					<p>Braiding Sweetgrass</i> has has been a book that so succinctly reflects my understanding and belief of gratitude and I really appreciate that. Being Two-Spirit reflects me.</p>
					<p>	This project is to give. Give back? I want to love people just how they are, how the see fit, in their own worlds.</p>

					<p>I've also wrestled with Black De Novo. Because I'm Black and that holds significance. And I learned 'de novo' from Jessica Jones Season 2. It means to begin a new. Or from what I understood from the show: to begin again; belonging nowhere. Which is how I often feel and seems to fit with the experience of traveling. </p>
