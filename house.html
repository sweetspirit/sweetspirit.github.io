				<p>The house is something I will build by hand and make with community. It is something I will share with the people who welcome me into their lives for a moment over food and stories. I intend it to be a space that is as accessible as possible for people who use power and manual wheelchairs and those with auditory issues and light sensitivities. There are several steps and processes involved to complete the house. The first steps being getting <a href="truck.html">a truck</a> and finding a build site! For a full list of my proposed steps, click <b><a href="house_build.html">here.</b></a>
