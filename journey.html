			<p>When the truck and house are ready to go, the journey is the time I spend on the road after I’ve acquired the <a href="truck.html">truck</a> and built the <a href="house.html">house</a>. I would like to spend at least 3 months in a location serving community while learning, teaching, caring, sharing, and growing. Skills I would like to learn, but aren’t limited to are herbal medicine, handwork crafting like woodworking and miniature modeling, food preparation including hunting and fishing, and other skills to use in nature. While I learn I’d like to teach what I can to folks who want it while also providing care in the ways that I can including general labor like helping folks run errands, clean, organize, or otherwise.</p>
			<h4><i>Ways you can contribute:</i></h4>
			<p>Help me make connections with folks and communities you want me to connect with, learn from, and give to: food skills, land to park on, craft skills, community support.</p>
