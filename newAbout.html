              <p>Earth-based skills such as foraging, navigation, hunting, farming, shelter making, and other activities that meet basic human needs are indigenous practices that have been manipulated, reimagined, and rebranded to generate profit for people who do not need these skills the most and usually arenâ€™t indigenous nor are they using that profit to serve either of these communities. This knowledge becomes so far removed from their origin they are no longer accessible and sometimes not even recognizable. </p>
              <p>My Recipes for Reparations project is to help bring that knowledge back, to give it back, to facilitate its growth in the communities the knowledge comes from. Reparations are a necessity to restore balance in the Earth. I use recipes as a tool not only as a play on the concept as it relates to food, or my love of alliteration, but to also serve as instruction or an option on how to provide a well-deserved and hefty dose of reparations to all famished communities. Recipes, of course, can be changed and rearranged to fit the needs of the cooks and hungry community and I hope they are.</p>
              <p>This project is an investment in corporeal care for the earth and the people. Across time and space, practices of the state and society have hindered the well being and development of Black and Native communities in what is commonly referred to as the United States. The bodies of the earth and the people, in this process, have been gnawed away at; the spirit and body consumed for their power leaving trauma in the wake. </p>
              <p>In all of this, I want to provide care. I want to love people as they are in their own worlds in their own languages.
I am asking a lot of myself in this project and a lot from others. This is possible. In taking on this endeavor, at the center of it all is relationship: to new friends and old, to the communities I meet, and to the earth. I need the help of old friends to make those new relationships; to go where I am needed and wanted and to be able to get there safely. My support page has a myriad of ways to contribute. I hope you can contribute in one of these ways or provide an idea about your own. </p>
