				<h3>What motivates you to do this?</h3>
				<p>Much of my reasoning is listed on the about page. For more background on those subject matters, check out these resources (Link).</p>
				<p>Generally, my desire is to meet people, hear stories, learn about food/plants/medicines, and feed people in the process. I want to learn about the myriad foodways of Black and Native peoples of this land mass we refer to as the United States.  I want to love people just how they are, how the see fit, in their own worlds.</p>
				<h3>Why the name <i>Sweet Spirit</i>?</h3>
				<p>I think it's kind of weird to name a house but it seems to be a common practice and this project should have some reference other than just "My Tiny House Project". So, out of my love for alliteration, I thought of Sweet Spirit.
				<p><i>Sweet</i> from sweetgrass inspired by my long journey of completing <i>Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants</i> by Robin Wall Kimmerer. Braiding Sweetgrass has been a book that so succinctly reflects my thoughts around gratitude and I really appreciate that. And <i>Spirit</i> from Two-Spirit (link) is me. In summary, the name casts who I am at the core into the light, but I need help to grow; I cannot do it on my own. So, I'm asking for help.</p>
				<h3>What do you think about the tiny house movement?</h3>
				<p>Some of my personal thoughts are described <a href="movement_thoughts.html">here</a>. Below are a few others that have informed mine.</p>
