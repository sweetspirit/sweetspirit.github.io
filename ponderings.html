        <h1>Tiny House Movement Thoughts</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="inner">

        <p>Tiny house videos and other media embedded in the “tiny house movement” are annoying to me because there is no real substance (to me). They never provide an answer to “Why? (at tiny house)” that I’m satisfied with. Videos mainly discuss the materials used to the construce the house, information about the appliances or the structure and organization of the house and finally, some sentimental tale form the owners or builders. Through the experiences I describe don’t reflect those of all small home dwellers, the disposition of the movement as I have observed is far removed from anything I can find myself giving a shit about.
<p>I would prefer, and dare I say love, to see residents and builders facilitate a culture of giving and reciprocity. Many folks involved with or interested in the movement speak about a desire to live with less, save money, have more time to live, help with the environment and other pseudo-environmentalist shit that holds to weight (beyond themselves).
<p>I term them pseudo-environmentalist because I cannot see how their choice to “go tiny” saves anyone beyond themself (for the moment). I believe an advocate for the enviroment is also an advocate for the people; an advocate for all living beings (mind you, there are plenty of them(. What are these folks doing for others who can’t afford the super affordable $10K, or even $2K tiny house? People who live in traditional trailers and trailer parks always and always will? What do they do with the rent money they save? Do they give it to the tribes or indigenous peoples whose lands they park on with their tiny house on wheels (thow)? What about the Black folks who live in shitty housing on land they weren’t invited to and didn’t provide consent to be on and can’t go anywhere else because of generations of restrictive housing policies? Like, what are they really doing what I can give a whole-hearted shit about? It’s also important to note that most of these houses aren’t accessible for more people with disabilities. Despite how they may be described as such. An average motorized wheelchair can’t get into the building nor rotate and navigate the space. Ladders and the like to lofted bed aren’t navigable for people in wheelchairs and many others. Disabled folks, whether disabilities be intellectual or physical, are often left out of conversations for the greater good. The tiny house movement creates space for more than enough for everyone yet everyone still doesn’t have enough.
