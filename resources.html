			<h3>What movtivates you to do this?</h3>
			<p>Much of my reasoning is listed on the about page. For more background on those subject matters, check out these resources (Link).</p>
			<p>Generally, my desire is to meet people, hear stories, learn about food/plants/medicines, and feed people in the process. I want to learn about the myriad foodways of Black and Native peoples of this land mass we refer to as the United States.  I want to love people just how they are, how the see fit, in their own worlds.</p>
			<h3>Why <i>Sweet Spirit</i>?</h3>
			<p>I think it's kind of weird to name a house but it seemed like this project should have some reference than just "My Tiny House Project". So, out of my love for alliteration, Sweet Spirit came up.
			<p><i>Sweet</i> from sweetgrass inspired from my long journey of completing <i>Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants</i> by Robin Wall Kimmerer. And <i>Spirit</i> from Two-Spirit (link). In summary, a healer is who I am but I need help to grow; I cannot do it on my own.</p>
			<p>Braiding Sweetgrass has has been a book that so succinctly reflects my understanding and belief of gratitude and I really appreciate that. Being Two-Spirit reflects me.</p>
			<p>I've also thought about Black De Novo after watching Jessica Jones. Because I'm Black and that holds significance. And I learned 'de novo' from Jessica Jones Season 2. It means to begin a new. Or from what I understood from the show: to begin again; belonging nowhere. Which is how I often feel and seems to fit with the experience of traveling.</p>
			<h3>What do you think about the tiny house movement?</h3>
			<p>Some of my personal thoughts are described <a href="movement_thoughts.html">here</a>. Below are a few others that have informed mine.</p>
