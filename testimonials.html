				<p>He engages with such deep thought and consideration for the world and those he interacts with. The way he approaches the world through his deep humanity, knowledge, and positionality makes him such an incredible valuable, special, and beautiful person. I am proud to know someone that brings such powerful, radical, and loving contributions to every space he occupies.    <i>-Rachel Muir,</i> Friend</p>

				<p>Logan Henderson is a wizard of empathy. A great listener, Logan knows some of this world’s best stories. Logan is committed to a radical conception of self and community that requires compassion, healing, honesty and justice!   <i>-Bobby,</i> Friend</p>
				<br>
				<p>I have known Logan since we were both 5 years old. Over the course of the last 18 years, I have watched him put everything he had into every project he has ever worked on. He is dedicated, driven, passionate, and fiercely loyal. I have no doubt that he will achieve whatever he dedicates his time and effort to.    <i>-Katey Hobkirk,</i> Friend</p>
				<br>
				<p>Logan is the type of employee who shows up an hour early every morning and still wishes he had arrived earlier. He’s extremely dependable, honest and hard working. I trust him to work with any client despite challenges. He is patient with each student and provides a space where they have an opportunity to learn and grow, in a supportive, encouraging environment. Other employees wanted to work with Logan for these reasons, in addition he is also sincere and direct which makes communication simple and clear. Logan is a rockstar employee.   <i>-Tanya,</i> Former supervisor</p>
