				<p>The trailer of the house needs to be solid and well-built as it will support the whole house. If the base isn't good, the whole house could fall apart!</p>
				<p>I would like the house (link) to be big enough to comfortably seat a group of people around a table, and small enough that I am able to tow it with the truck (link) (with practice of course!)</p>
				<p>I believe that a trailer [?] ft long will be enough to fit 12 people around the table while also being small enough that to tow it isn't too great of a challenge.</p>
